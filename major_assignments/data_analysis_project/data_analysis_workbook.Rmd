This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

1.  The state with the most retail power suppliers in both 2013 and 2023 appears to be Pennsylvania, with 43 entities in 2013 and 80 in 2023. With that said, the highest customer count in 2013 could actually be found in Ohio, which boasted a sum of 1,671,807 paying customers that year. The highest customer count for 2023 would be California, at 761,361. Even with far more power suppliers from both 2013 and 2023, customer counts in PA aren't as high as some other states.

2.  According to the 2010 census, the population of Maine was 1,328,361. If my code above is correct, than this would make Maine's New Brunswick Power Generation Corp energy supplier the company with the most per-capita customers for that year, sitting at about 364 per 1000 residents. That's a pretty massive ratio. Beneath NBPGC, Maine shows up several more times (spots 3, 4, and 5) with similarly high per capita ratings (118, 102, 94.) It doesn't surprise me that Maine is so heavily represented in this data â€“ it's a pretty large state with a lot of infrastructure, as well as a relatively low population. \
    \
    In Comparison, According to my code, Rhode Island's NextEra Energy Services LLC would be the 2023 state with the most per capita customers, at a population of 1,052,567, a sum customer count of 77904, and a per-capita count of 74. Compared to the 2013 data, this data set sees a higher representation of New England states with high per capita customer counts (MA's Constellation Energy Inc. at 73 in second place, NH's Direct Energy Services at 49 in fourth, etc.). One wonders how the energy industry might have changed over the last ten years to draw in more New England customers, and yet the deeper question in, why are the per-capita counts so much lower? This 2023 data's highest per capita count pales (74 for every 1000) pales in comparison with the triple-digit capita counts in 2013. Could an increasingly competitive and privatized industry have seen lower overall customer counts from one company to another? Given more time, would this be an observable pattern over all of the data? These are interesting points of further inquiry. \
    \
    All of these per capita answers presuppose that population shifts haven't occurred from the 2010 census taking to the 2013 data and from the 2020 census taking to the 2023 data. The former might be a relatively safe assumption, but the latter seems more suspect. The 2020 census happened right in the middle of a pandemic, and it might be incorrect to assume that it's population value is still accurate enough for comparison against 2023 data.
